# AI Grid Simulation: A* and UCS Algorithms

This project implements a grid-based simulation featuring two AI pathfinding algorithms: **A\*** and **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**. The simulation involves an agent navigating a grid to complete tasks while avoiding barriers.

## Features

- **A\* Algorithm**: Uses a heuristic (Manhattan distance) to find the optimal path to the nearest task.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Finds the shortest path to the nearest task by considering the cost of each move.
- **Dynamic Task Completion**: Tasks are dynamically generated, and the agent completes them by navigating around barriers.
- **Pygame Visualization**: Visual feedback via Pygame displays the grid, tasks, barriers, and the agent's movement in real time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- Pygame  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.  
2. Run the run.py file to start the simulation:
 
 This will open a Pygame window where the agent navigates the grid to complete tasks using either the A* or UCS algorithm, which can be triggered by clicking on their respective buttons in the status panel.  

 ## Key Components

 -  agent.Py
   
   *Defines the Agent class, which represents the agent navigating the grid.
Implements methods for pathfinding using both A* and UCS.
Handles task completion and cost tracking.
Provides methods to move the agent along the path generated by each algorithm.

- environment.py

 Defines the Environment class, which manages the grid, tasks, and barriers.
Generates random task locations and barriers.
Ensures the agent's movement stays within the grid bounds and avoids barriers.

- run.py

 Sets up the Pygame window and controls the main simulation loop.
Draws the grid, agent, tasks, barriers, and displays the current state and costs.
Handles user interactions (button clicks to start A* or UCS simulations).
Updates the agentâ€™s movement and task completion in real-time.
